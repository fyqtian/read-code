### GC



```go
// gcenable is called after the bulk of the runtime initialization,
// just before we're about to start letting user code run.
// It kicks off the background sweeper goroutine, the background
// scavenger goroutine, and enables GC.
func gcenable() {
   // Kick off sweeping and scavenging.
   c := make(chan int, 2)
   go bgsweep(c)
   go bgscavenge(c)
   <-c
   <-c
   memstats.enablegc = true // now that runtime is initialized, GC is okay
}

// start forcegc helper goroutine
func init() {
	go forcegchelper()
}

func forcegchelper() {
	forcegc.g = getg()
	lockInit(&forcegc.lock, lockRankForcegc)
	for {
		lock(&forcegc.lock)
		if forcegc.idle != 0 {
			throw("forcegc: phase error")
		}
		atomic.Store(&forcegc.idle, 1)
		goparkunlock(&forcegc.lock, waitReasonForceGCIdle, traceEvGoBlock, 1)
		// this goroutine is explicitly resumed by sysmon
		if debug.gctrace > 0 {
			println("GC forced")
		}
		// Time-triggered, fully concurrent.
		gcStart(gcTrigger{kind: gcTriggerTime, now: nanotime()})
	}
}


// stopTheWorld stops all P's from executing goroutines, interrupting
// all goroutines at GC safe points and records reason as the reason
// for the stop. On return, only the current goroutine's P is running.
// stopTheWorld must not be called from a system stack and the caller
// must not hold worldsema. The caller must call startTheWorld when
// other P's should resume execution.
//
// stopTheWorld is safe for multiple goroutines to call at the
// same time. Each will execute its own stop, and the stops will
// be serialized.
//
// This is also used by routines that do stack dumps. If the system is
// in panic or being exited, this may not reliably stop all
// goroutines.
func stopTheWorld(reason string) {

		// Mark the goroutine which called stopTheWorld preemptible so its
		// stack may be scanned.
		// This lets a mark worker scan us while we try to stop the world
		// since otherwise we could get in a mutual preemption deadlock.
		// We must not modify anything on the G stack because a stack shrink
		// may occur. A stack shrink is otherwise OK though because in order
		// to return from this function (and to leave the system stack) we
		// must have preempted all goroutines, including any attempting
		// to scan our stack, in which case, any stack shrinking will
		// have already completed by the time we exit.

	// gomaxprocs cannot change while worldsema is held.
